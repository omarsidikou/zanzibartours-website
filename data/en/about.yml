      Explore the World Heritage Site of Stone Town, Zanzibar City’s old quarter.
      Former palaces and Arab mansions along the twisting streets of Stone Town hint at a grander age for this port city on the western coast of Zanzibar.
      The Old Fort, built in the 1700s to fend off the Portuguese, now hosts local performances, a café and an art gallery. Overstuffed bazaars lend an air of nonstop bustle. Mafia Island Marine Park sits just offshore, a haven for snorkeling the local reefs.

    title : Prison island
    description : >
        From Stone Town, you can take a boat in order to go to Prison Island.
        The British First Minister of Zanzibar, Lloyd Mathews, purchased the island in 1893 and constructed a prison complex there.
        No prisoners were ever housed on the island and instead it became a quarantine station for yellow fever cases.
        Now, you will see giant aldabra tortoise and an old prison which was never used.
